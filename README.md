# 🚀 Turborepo Template

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** - A modern, lightweight Turborepo template for p-stack organization with essential open-source project configurations

## ⚠️ Development Status

**This template is currently under active development.** Many features and configurations are still being implemented and refined. The template is not yet ready for production use.

## 📋 Description

This template provides a foundation for creating new Turborepo-based repositories with all the essential configurations needed for open-source project management. It includes pre-configured issue templates, PR templates, contribution guidelines, and modern tooling setup to help you get started quickly.

## 🎯 What Problems Does This Solve?

When starting a new open-source repository, developers often spend significant time setting up:

- **Issue and PR templates** for consistent contribution workflows
- **Code of Conduct** and **Contributing guidelines** for community management  
- **Branch protection rules** and **conventional commit** conventions
- **Basic project structure** with modern tooling configurations
- **License** and **documentation** setup

This template eliminates that initial setup overhead, allowing you to focus on building your project from day one.
